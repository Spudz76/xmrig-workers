# xmrig-workers

This project is source code of http://workers.xmrig.info/ dashboard. Content of the [public](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-workers/tree/master/public) directory is ready for self-hosting. [Example configuration](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-workers/blob/master/config/xmrig-workers.conf) for nginx provided.

Dashboard is not actively developed. You may take a look at a more featured alternative implementation: https://github.com/ludufre/xmworkers. See also [discussion](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/1772).
